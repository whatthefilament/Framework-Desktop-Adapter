# Framework-Desktop-Adapter

3D Printable Mounts to adapt Framework motherboard to ATX and Micro-ATX Motherboards and Cases

Feel free to remix/mod to your needs. 

Each model uses standard sizing and mounting points. 

Any board smaller than Micro-ATX is too small for Framework Motherboard to fit.
